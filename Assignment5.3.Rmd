# 3. What is the Major difference between str c() and paste(). show an example
  #The difference is for str_c() the default is no separator, 
  #so it acts just like paste0() as a default. 
  #Paste() and paste0() are both functions from the base package, 
  #whereas str_c() comes from the stringr package.

#paste with seperator with _

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
